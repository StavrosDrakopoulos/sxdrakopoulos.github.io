## About Me

[DRAFT]
I was born on May 19, 1993 in Athens, the capital of Greece.

I am a Materials Scientist (University of Patras 🇬🇷) with a Ph.D. in Materials Engineering (Loughborough University 🇬🇧) and a specialty in polymer physics. I spent a total of 3 years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Universities of Birmingham and Bath 🇬🇧 focusing on electrode manufacturing for Li-ion batteries, and polymer dielectric physics respectively.

As of June 2023 I have been working at Princeton Materials Institute located at Princeton University 🇺🇲 as an Associate Research Scholar. My research at Princeton is focused on polymer physics and dielectrics.

I am the co-author of 2 book chapters and 26 peer-reviewed scientific journal publications that have attracted over 650 citations according to Google Scholar. My future ambition is one day to lead my own research group and explore new materials for energy storage applications that will benefit the technological progress of humanity.
